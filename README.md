## Why Biopass?

While Windows Hello provides a seamless multi-modal biometric experience (Face, Fingerprint, PIN) on Windows 11, Linux has historically lacked a modern, unified equivalent. The most well-known project in this space, [Howdy](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy), focuses exclusively on facial recognition and has not seen significant updates in recent years.

Biopass was developed by [@phucvinh57](https://github.com/phucvinh57) and [@thaitran24](https://github.com/thaitran24) to fill this gap, providing a fast, secure, and modern biometric suite that goes beyond just face ID.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Modalities** | Face + Fingerprint | Face ID only |
| **User Interface** | Modern GUI for management | Command-line interface only |
| **Configuration** | GUI | Manual |
| **Face Anti-spoofing** | Built-in liveness detection | Limited (Requires IR camera for security) |
